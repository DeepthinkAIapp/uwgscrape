When I seen your post about needing a Technical Marketing Weapon I felt like you guys were speaking directly to me….






My main focus lately has been keeping up on googles updates and staying up to date with the AI tools and open source LLMs




Run Scraper:
Pond_finder_scrapery.py
Competitor_scraper


Barcode Scanner: Idea is to scan the actual text from a sheet rather then put barcodes on each tool. Use search to find category or tool. Database on Supabase with test inventory.


Also have the lead smart funnel (readme.md)
