          <h3>Water Quality Benefits</h3>
          <p>Each plant type contributes to water quality in different ways. Water lilies provide shade and nutrient absorption, marginal plants filter edge water, and floating plants offer rapid nutrient uptake.</p>
          
          <h2>Utah-Specific Growing Tips</h2>
          <p>Utah's unique climate requires special considerations for aquatic plant success.</p>
          
          <h3>Winter Protection</h3>
          <p>Most water lilies and marginal plants can survive Utah winters with adequate water depth (18+ inches). Floating plants will die and need spring replacement.</p>
          
          <h3>Summer Heat Management</h3>
          <p>Utah's intense summer sun requires adequate plant coverage to protect fish and control water temperature. Ensure proper plant density and consider partial shade for sensitive varieties.</p>
          
          <h3>Water Quality Considerations</h3>
          <p>Utah's hard water can affect plant growth. Regular water testing and appropriate treatments may be necessary for optimal plant performance.</p>
          
          <h2>Plant Selection by Pond Size</h2>
          <p>Choose plants that match your pond size and growing conditions.</p>
          
          <h3>Small Ponds (Under 100 square feet)</h3>
          <p>Focus on smaller water lily varieties, compact marginal plants, and easy-to-manage floating plants. Avoid aggressive spreaders that can quickly overwhelm small spaces.</p>
          
          <h3>Medium Ponds (100-500 square feet)</h3>
          <p>Mix of medium-sized water lilies, various marginal plants, and floating plants. This size allows for good plant diversity while remaining manageable.</p>
          
          <h3>Large Ponds (Over 500 square feet)</h3>
          <p>Can accommodate larger water lily varieties, extensive marginal plantings, and multiple floating plant species. More space allows for greater plant diversity and natural spread.</p>
          
          <h2>Common Plant Problems and Solutions</h2>
          <p>Understanding common issues helps prevent problems before they occur.</p>
          
          <h3>Insufficient Blooming</h3>
          <p>Usually caused by inadequate sunlight, insufficient fertilization, or incorrect planting depth. Ensure 6+ hours of direct sun and monthly fertilization during growing season.</p>
          
          <h3>Poor Growth</h3>
          <p>May be caused by incorrect planting depth, poor soil, inadequate water circulation, or water quality issues. Check all growing conditions and adjust as needed.</p>
          
          <h3>Overcrowding</h3>
          <p>Regular division and maintenance prevent overcrowding. Most aquatic plants benefit from division every 3-4 years to maintain vigor.</p>
          
          <h2>Design Ideas for Utah Ponds</h2>
          <p>Create stunning water gardens with strategic plant placement and selection.</p>
          
          <h3>Color Combinations</h3>
          <p>Combine plants with different flower colors and foliage textures. Yellow and white water lilies work well together, while pink varieties add romantic appeal.</p>
          
          <h3>Height Variations</h3>
          <p>Use marginal plants of different heights to create visual interest. Tall plants like Yellow Flag Iris provide vertical structure, while lower plants create natural transitions.</p>
          
          <h3>Seasonal Interest</h3>
          <p>Select plants with different bloom times to extend the flowering season from spring through fall. Include plants with interesting seed heads for winter interest.</p>
          
          <h2>Maintenance Schedule</h2>
          <p>Proper maintenance ensures your aquatic plants remain healthy and beautiful year after year.</p>
          
          <h3>Spring Tasks</h3>
          <p>Remove winter debris, divide overgrown plants, add new plants, and begin fertilization. Test water quality and adjust as needed.</p>
          
          <h3>Summer Care</h3>
          <p>Monitor plant growth, thin overcrowded areas, continue fertilization, and manage floating plant coverage. Watch for signs of stress during hot weather.</p>
          
          <h3>Fall Preparation</h3>
          <p>Remove tender floating plants, cut back hardy plants, and prepare for winter. Clean up debris and ensure adequate water depth for winter survival.</p>
          
          <h3>Winter Monitoring</h3>
